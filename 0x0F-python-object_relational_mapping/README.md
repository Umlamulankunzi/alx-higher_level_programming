# Python - Object-relational mapping

## Introduction

Welcome to this project that links two amazing worlds: Databases and Python! In this project, I will be using the module MySQLdb to connect to a MySQL database and execute SQL queries.I will also be using the module SQLAlchemy, an Object Relational Mapper (ORM).

The biggest advantage of using an ORM is that I no longer need to write SQL queries. The purpose of an ORM is to abstract the storage to the usage, which means that my biggest concern will be "What can I do with my objects?" and not "How is this object stored? Where? When?".I will only need to write Python code, and my code won't be "storage type" dependent. This means that I will be able to change my storage easily without re-writing the entire project.

In the first part of the project, I will connect to a MySQL database and execute SQL queries using the module MySQLdb. In the second part, I will use the module SQLAlchemy to work with an ORM. I will create an engine using the create_engine function, and then create a session using the Session function. With the session, I will be able to query the database without writing any SQL queries, only using objects.

One of the biggest difficulties with using an ORM is the syntax. While all ORMs have the same type of syntax, they are not always the same.
