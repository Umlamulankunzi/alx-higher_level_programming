# Python Network

## Overview
This project is focused on exploring Python programming concepts related to network connections and web requests. Specifically, I will be using the urllib and requests modules to connect to websites, retrieve responses, and extract important information such as status codes and X-request IDs.

## Key Features
- Utilization of Python programming concepts to establish network connections and retrieve web resources.
- Understanding of the urllib and requests modules for web requests.
- Ability to extract important information from web responses, such as status codes and X-request IDs.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- urllib
- requests


## Conclusion
By the end of this project, I aim to have a solid understanding of Python programming concepts related to network connections and web requests. I intend to also have gained experience working with the urllib and requests modules, as well as extracting and utilizing important information from web responses.
